FFi Reason for Existence
========================


The FFi mission is similar to Mozilla's mission. FFi is dedicated to creating and maintaining an open fashion industry, and Mozilla aims to do the same for the internet. Due to the secretive nature of the fashion industry, it isn't clear to the public or the industry itself how to solve fashion's problems. We believe that creating an open, transparent fashion industry through open source tools is essential before these problems can be solved.

__________________________
Summary of problems:

1. Fashion's software tools are written to meet the needs of the large industry players. The computer industry 
faced a similar situation when IBM and big iron met only the needs of big industry players. In the late 
1970's the personal computer began development. The personal computer empowered the 99% and changed the world.
The FFi is promoting tools which will accomplish similar results in the fashion industry.

2. Fashion's production methodologies don't reflect the values of its designer and consumer communities
    - Unsavory labor conditions are also a business liability
    - Toxic waste and large percentages of unsold inventory are unacceptable from both ecological and profit-
      ability point of views.
      
3. Fashion's secretive culture prevents innovation. Old Henry-Ford-Era and even Victorian-era 
workflows and assumptions are encoded into current proprietary software. Basic work tasks must be repeated 
each time a new product is designed. Engineering efficiencies have not been incorporated into fashion. Reusability
and collaboration are essential all design fields except fashion. Fashion critics admit that fashion depends on 
copy/mix/reuse to keep up with design trends but the tools to produce fashion excludes encoding of these concepts.
Open source software can bring desired chages to this outdated industry culture.

Summary of solutions:

FFi works to support the development of open source tools which address issues ignored by current industry tools and workflows:
    - copy/mix/reuse
    - reduced waste
        -- toxins
        -- materials
        -- time
    - improved customer alignment
        -- improved fit
        -- improved quality
        -- improved creativity
    - improved profits
        -- reduced returns due to better fit & quality
        -- reduced risk (better profit prediction)
        -- reduced acceptance of poor labor conditions during manufacturing phase "last mile of production" 
           which yield minimal profit increases
        -- application of engineering efficiencies during design phase "first mile of production" yields greater profits
    - increased creativity
        -- collaboration between designers, teams, companies, manufacturers
        -- less reliance on existing design memes 
        -- utilization of latest technology without being restricted by legacy software and outmoded workflows

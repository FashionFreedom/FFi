Mission Statement

=================


The Fashion Freedom Initiative is a non-profit organization to champion, 
support, develop, and defend a healthy fashion industry – keeping it open,
 accessible, and sustainable throughout the world.



Purpose

=======


The Fashion Freedom Initiative (in short: Fashion Freedom) has been
 established to facilitate and support an open, transparent and efficient 
governance process throughout the future development of technology,
 conferences, hackathons, and auxiliary materials (such as documentation, 
tests, validators, and tutorials) developed within the Fashion Freedom user 
and developer community.

 Fashion Freedom seeks to provide guidance, oversight and coordination of 
activities as well as a long-term, multi-stakeholder and architectural 
perspective.



Legal Status

============


Fashion Freedom is the name of a not-for-profit technical and creative 
community effort serving the public benefit. Fashion Freedom is 
established as a Programme within [The Commons Conservancy]. [The 
Commons Conservancy] is a not-for-profit foundation ('Stichting') 
established under The Netherlands law. 

Terms contained in this document refer to the respective definitions 
of these terms within the regulations of [The Commons Conservancy], 
unless explicitly noted otherwise. The Programme is subject to the
 conditions set forth in the Statutes and Regulations of [The Commons
Conservancy], more in particular to the conditions stipulated in [The 
Commons Conservancy] DRACC 0002. References to the Statutes or 
Regulations of Fashion Freedom therefore automatically mean the 
combination of the Statutes and Regulations of the Programme and those 
of [The Commons Conservancy]. 

Any decisions made or approved by the Fashion Freedom Board of 
Directors within the scope of its mandate will be handled according to
 the procedure set out in DRACC "Decision Handling Procedure". New 
(versions of) Fashion Freedom Statutes and Regulations enter into
 effect when they are published as part of the DRACC series of [The 
Commons Conservancy].



Financial considerations

========================


Fashion Freedom operates on a nil budget, which means there are no 
direct financial considerations. 

Fashion Freedom Board of Directors determines the desired direction of
 the development of technology, auxiliary materials, conferences, and
 additional resources and activities. At the request of grantmaking 
organisations, donors and partners, Fashion Freedom MAY work with or 
provide guidance and inspiration to others regarding the establishment and 
evaluation of activities. Fashion Freedom itself will have no direct
 financial involvement in such activities under any circumstances.



Governance

==========


The central decision making body within Fashion Freedom is the Fashion
 Freedom Board of Directors (in short: Fashion Freedom Board). The 
Fashion Freedom Board is a meritocratic committee responsible for
 making and coordinating decisions on behalf of the user and developer 
community around Fashion Freedom, according to the conditions set 
forth in these Statutes as well as any Regulations established by
 prior decisions of the Fashion Freedom Board.

 The Fashion Freedom Board has a minimum of three, and a maximum of
 seven natural persons. The founding Fashion Freedom Board has 
appointed a number of its constituting Directors to serve a half (12
 month) term, and the remainder to serve a regular (24 month) term.
 Subsequent Directors are elected by the Fashion Freedom Board to 
regular 24 month terms according to the procedure set out in these 
Statutes. Directors are permitted to seek office for multiple terms, 
however, when running against other candidates the amount of terms 
they have consecutively served is deducted from the votes cast in
their favour. This provides a balance between continuity, equal 
opportunities and renewal of qualities and competences. 

The Fashion Freedom Board determines the Programme's structure and 
processes, and is responsible for maintaining its Statutes and
 Regulations. The Fashion Freedom Board is free to make or revise any
 decision, taking into consideration applicable law as well as any
 immutable conditions previously established within the Statutes or
 Regulations. 

In order to efficiently fulfill its tasks, the Board may establish 
specialized committees and taskforces, as well as assign named roles 
to qualified individuals to provide advice and assistance on specific 
issues. The associated qualifications, tasks and responsibilities
 SHALL be formalised by publication as part of the Regulations of 
Fashion Freedom. 

The Fashion Freedom Board (and any person, group or organisation 
mandated by the Fashion Freedom Board on its behalf) must act in good
 faith and in the common interest of the developer community and the
 wider user community of Fashion Freedom. If significant harm to the
 organization has been committed by any Director, he or she MAY be 
removed from the Board by a simple majority vote of the rest of the 
Board.

The Fashion Freedom Board SHALL convene offline or online at least 
every twelve (12) months.



Voting procedure

================


Any two Fashion Freedom Directors MAY jointly organise a vote of the 
Fashion Freedom Board on any subject, after which a notification SHALL 
be sent out by email to each Director detailing the proposed action 
and the deadline.

Each Director is entitled to one (1) vote on each matter submitted to
a vote. Voting happens through an electronic voting system, by email 
vote or by a quorate (online) meeting. A quorum is reached when all 
Directors are either (tele)present, have appointed a proxy or have s
indicated they will abstain from voting. 

It is the responsibility of each Director to maintain valid contact 
details for communication within the Board. When a Director does not 
respond to multiple communication requests or invitations to vote for
a period of one month across at least two different channels, he or 
she is removed from the quorum count until contact is restored.

 Regular decisions of the Fashion Freedom Board are taken by a simple 
majority.  Any amendment to these Statutes requires a consensus of the 
entire Fashion Freedom Board minus one Director. In all cases, the 
Chair of the Fashion Freedom board casts the deciding vote in case of
a tie. 

Each Director agrees to use his best efforts to resolve disputes in an 
informal manner.



Integrity

=========


All Fashion Freedom Directors (as well as any persons the Fashion
Freedom Board have delegated tasks and/or responsibilities to) are 
understood to act as fiduciaries with regard to the Fashion Freedom
 Programme, and their duties include, but are not limited to, the 
fiduciary duty of care and the fiduciary duty of loyalty.

Directors SHOULD NOT receive any personal benefit as a result of a
pending decision -- he or she is required to explain the circumstances
and avoid taking any part in the decision.

 Any conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest between
Fashion Freedom and individual Directors MUST be avoided. Directors 
undertake to declare any interest in any item under discussion and MAY 
be invited by the Fashion Freedom Chair to withdraw from discussions 
when business concerning their personal interests or the interests of
 natural or legal persons close to them is being dealt with. Directors 
MUST heed such an invitation and at the very least abstain from
voting.

 Decisions involving activities under which one or more Directors would
 have conflicts of interest that are of material significance to the
Programme and/or to the relevant Director(s) require the approval of 
the entire Fashion Freedom Board minus the Director(s) with a conflict 
of interest.



Licensing policy

================


All software and content created or maintained within Fashion Freedom 
is to be made publically available perpetually at no cost under one or 
more of the licenses on the Free Software Foundation's list of 
"recommended copyleft licenses" or any license approved by the Open
Source Initiative on or after the submission date. 

When additional licensing needs (which would make the identical 
software or assets available also through licenses not on those lists) 
arise, the Fashion Freedom Board is responsible for deciding on a case
 by case basis how this shall be best dealt with. In such matters the 
Board SHALL act in the common interest of the user and developer
community, respectful of the spirit and intents of the original 
creators of and contributors to Fashion Freedom. 

Any financial benefits resulting from licensing agreements with third 
parties shall exclusively be directed towards a not-for-profit
 organisation aligned with the goals of Fashion Freedom as contribution 
to the future development and maintenance of Fashion Freedom. These 
contributions shall be spent under the responsibility of the Fashion 
Freedom Board, on behalf of the Fashion Freedom user and developer
 community and in the general public interest.
